# 仕事: AI Resume Assist

仕事（しごと,）aka Shigoto, is a program designed to match your resume to a job description. It takes descriptions from your resume and tailors them to the specific job description on a listing. By utilizing ChatGPT, it automates this process when you provide the job listing and your resume/cover letter. This helps you create a closer match, enhancing your resume's appeal to recruiters who use software to detect similarities between the job description and your application. Shigoto is a work in progress and currently in the early stages of development.
